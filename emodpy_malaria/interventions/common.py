        trigger_condition_list: A list of the events that will trigger intervention distribution.
        listening_duration: The number of time steps that the distributed event will monitor for triggers.
            Default is -1, which is indefinitely.
        delay_period_constant: Optional. Delay, in days, before the intervention is given out after a trigger
            is received.
        demographic_coverage: This value is the probability that each individual in the target population will
            receive the intervention. It does not guarantee that the exact fraction of the target population set by
            Demographic_Coverage receives the intervention.
        node_ids: List of nodes to which to distribute the intervention. [] or None, indicates all nodes
            will get the intervention
        repetitions: The number of times an intervention is given, used with timesteps_between_repetitions. -1 means
            the intervention repeats forever. Sets **Number_Repetitions**
        timesteps_between_repetitions: The interval, in timesteps, between repetitions. Ignored if repetitions = 1.

        disqualifying_properties: A list of IndividualProperty key:value pairs that cause an intervention to be aborted.
            Generally used to control the flow of health care access. For example, to prevent the same individual from
            accessing health care via two different routes at the same time.
        target_age_min: The lower end of ages targeted for an intervention, in years. Sets **Target_Age_Min**
        target_age_max: The upper end of ages targeted for an intervention, in years. Sets **Target_Age_Max**
        target_gender: The gender targeted for an intervention: All, Male, or Female.
        target_residents_only: When set to True, the intervention is only distributed to individuals that began
            the simulation in the node (i.e. those that claim the node as their residence)
        blackout_event_trigger: The event to broadcast if an intervention cannot be distributed due to the
            **Blackout_Period**.
        blackout_period: After the initial intervention distribution, the time, in days, to wait before distributing
            the intervention again. If it cannot distribute due to the blackout period, it will broadcast the
            user-defined **Blackout_Event_Trigger**.
